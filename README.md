# Zero-RL Mini

A minimalist reproduction of zero RL as performed in DeepSeek R1.

## Milestones

- [ ] Evaluate Qwen-2.5-0.5B on GSM8K test set
- [ ] Create the training dataset from GSM8K and MATH
- [ ] Setup zero RL training using verl
- [ ] Train Qwen-2.5-0.5B using zero RL
- [ ] Compare model performances
